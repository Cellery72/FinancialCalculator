# FinancialCalculator

This is an app I'm working on to read in .csv files from my bank, (TD Canada Trust currently) of my transaction history up to a certain period. With time I'd like to make a small budgeting app to help myself in the long run. 

I've included a .gitignore file to ignore all .csv files as they will most definetly contain sensitive information.
